# Image Segmentation Using U-Net

Image segmentation is the process of classifying the pixels in a digital image to different classes. There are two types of image segmentation : Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation.

In semantic segmentation, pixels belonging to a given class as classified as one label whereas in instance segmentation each instance of a specific class are assigned a separate label.

In this repo I have implemented a simple U-net to demonstrate the use case of image segmentation.
